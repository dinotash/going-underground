	<h1>Going Underground</h1>
	<p>You're on the Victoria Line looking at the people opposite. You have to avoid making eye contact. It's rude to stare.</p>

	<p>Here's the rules of the game:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Your attention is drawn to the person nearest where you're looking.</li>
		<li>Use the arrow keys to control where you're looking.</li>
		<li>Your bounce back if you move it to the edge of what you can see.</li>
		<li>If you don't press an arrow key for five seconds, you lose control.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>I wrote Going Underground using processing.js. It is available under an MIT licence.</p>

		<h2>Random character generation</h2>
		<p>My favorite part about making this game was making a different cast of passengers for every game. London is a very diverse place with all kinds of people in it. There are around 75 quadrillion possible people for you to look at!</p>
		<p>The game has a weighted random probability function to decide if each passenger should be male, female, bespectacled, bearded, bald, and wearing a skirt, dress, v-neck top or showing their midriff. It also has a set palette of colors for hair, skin, eyes, pants and shoes, although shirts can be any colour. Heights and lengths of clothes are also random, within a range.</p>
